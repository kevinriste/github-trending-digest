# Recommendations (from Codex, not Claude)

These recommendations were generated by Codex (OpenAI), not Claude.

1. Add a retry/backoff wrapper for GitHub and raw README requests to reduce flakiness.
2. Persist the scraped repo data and AI summaries as JSON alongside HTML for easier reuse.
3. Cache README fetches per repo/date to avoid repeated network calls during reruns.
4. Make the OpenAI prompt configurable via a CLI flag or env var.
5. Add a dry-run mode that skips git commit/push and email for local testing.
6. Consider writing a small smoke test that validates HTML output contains 10 repos.
